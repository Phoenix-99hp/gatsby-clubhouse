# Gatsby Clubhouse

Deployed: 

This is clubhouse website made using Gatsby and React. Users may post messages, and the ten most recent messages are displayed by default. There are three separate user statuses: Admin, Member, and Non-Member. Admins may write and delete messages, Members may write and view messages, and Non-Members may only view the username and timestamp of posted messages. Becoming an Admin or Member requires successful entry of a password, and Non-Member and Member accounts may upgrade to Member or Admin status at any time.
