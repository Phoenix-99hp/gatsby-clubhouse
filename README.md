# Gatsby Clubhouse

Deployed: https://salty-sierra-48384.herokuapp.com/

This is a clubhouse website made using Gatsby and React. It was inspired by the Odin Project's curriculum. Users may post messages, and the ten most recent messages are displayed by default. There are three separate user statuses: Admin, Member, and Non-Member. Admins may write and delete messages, Members may write and view messages, and Non-Members may only view the username and timestamp of posted messages. Becoming an Admin or Member requires successful entry of a password, and Non-Member and Member accounts may upgrade to Member or Admin status at any time.
